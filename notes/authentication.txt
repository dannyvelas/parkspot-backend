* Strategies to use authentication middleware:
  * use built-in go-chi authentication:
    * PRO: nice and simple
    * CON: using contexts to control instead of inform
  * use jack-lindamood logic:
    * PRO: inputs to authentication are strongly typed
    * CON: difficult to implement with go-chi routing
  * Simply wrapping routing functions with Authorize() function
    * PRO: nice and simple
    * CON: verbose, would have to do this for pretty much every function
