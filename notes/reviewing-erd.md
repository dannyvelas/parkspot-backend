* Should we take off the `car_id` foreign key from the permit table?
* In the visitor table, there is a `relationship_id` field. What is this for?
* I understand that we would need to have a table called `Visitor_Parking_Policy` that should be associated 1-1 with a community. But, why do we need to have a relationship between `Visitor_Parking_Policy` and a `Resident`? It seems like this is being used to determine the privilege that a resident has. Instead, it might be better if we had a field for resident called like "privilege" or something. It would be an enum like "low", "medium", "high". And then the `Visitor_Parking_Policy` table of a community would define: the visitor parking privileges of residents with low privilege, the visitor parking privileges of residents with medium privilege, and the visitor parking privileges of residents with high privilege.
* In the current implementation, the resident table has a foreign key that maps to the car table. This represents the visitor cars associated to a resident account. I don't see this in your ERD. Should we change visitor cars to be related to the visitors table instead? Or should we have the resident table have two fields: `visitor_cars` and `self_cars` (or some other name).
* What's the benefit of having a "Building" table?
